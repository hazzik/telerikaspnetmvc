    This example shows how Telerik DatePicker for ASP.NET MVC is using build-in client validation of the ASP.NET MVC 2.0
</p>
<p>
    Validation of the Model is based on the <em>DataAnnotations</em>. Except, all required actions to enable build-in client validation,
    important thing is that the datepicker should have the same name as the validated property of the Model. In other words
    if <strong>OrderDate</strong> is a property of the Model, datepicker should be named "OrderDate".
</p>
<p>
    Here is the definition of the <em>OrderDate</em> property, which is validated in this demo:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
        [Required]
        public DateTime? OrderDate
        {
            get;
            set;
        }
</pre>
<p>
    The <strong>[Required]</strong> attribute comes from the <em>System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally you can use <em>DatePickerFor</em> extension in order to create DatePicker for a concrete <em>Model property</em>.
    If it has <strong>Range</strong> attribute, DatePicker component will use it to define min and max date
    contraints.
